```{r, mychunk1}

summary(cars)

plot(mtcars$`wt`,mtcars$`mpg`,xlab="weight",ylab="mpg",main="mtcars")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
